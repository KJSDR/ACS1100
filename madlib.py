# Homework: Create a madlib. Imagine a story where some of the words are 
# supplied by user input. Using python you will use input to collect 
# words for a story and then display the story. 

# Use input to collect each word to a variable
# Use an f string to display the story

# Your madlib must collect at least 6 words!





first_name = input("Enter your first name")
city_country = input("Enter the city and country you are from")
favorite_hobby = input("Enter your favorite hobby")
favorite_meal = input("Enter your favorite meal")
favorite_holiday = input("Enter your favorite holiday")
thing_without = input("Enter something you could not live without")





print(f"Hello my name is {first_name}, I am from {city_country} and my favorite hobby is {favorite_hobby}. My favorite meal is {favorite_meal} and my favorite holiday is {favorite_holiday}. One thing I could not live without is {thing_without}.")
